        <h2>
            1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.
        </h2>
        <p>
            IT and technology in general, has become indispensable in the modern world of business. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I would not have been able to do even the simplest of tasks without the use of my computer and the software designed for finance professionals. I just try to imagine having to write out investment models on a piece of paper, without a life feed of current stock prices. It would have made my job completely impossible!
            <br>
            <br>
            The ever increasing expansion and development of Information Technologies has proven to be vital now, more than ever. The Covid-19 pandemic that swept the world at the end of 2019 and forced millions into lock down, would have left those people without a chance at continuing working. Instead, they were able to continue doing their jobs from the safety of their home. 
            <br>
            I suppose if one were to describe the actual purpose of IT in modern business, it would be that it allows the business to operate in the modern world. I can hardly imagine a company, no matter how non-IT in nature, that doesn't use a computer to store sales records, the internet to connect with clients or online banking to complete their day-to-day transactions. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.
        </h2>
        <p>
            What I've learnt is that digital projects, especially ones involving coding, require a lot of consistency, clear-headedness, and most importantly patience. 
            <br>
            It is vital to check your work often and consistently, particularly after a change in the code has been made. This allows for quick identification and correction of an issue, should one arise. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is an abundance of resources online, for just about any programming language one could want to learn. I found it particularly useful to implement e.g. a new command I learnt about, into my code to see how it would behave on my own. 
            This, not only allowed me to test the new command, but also helped me to remember it for the future.
            The resources I found most useful, outside of what was taught in the classroom, would definitely be the various in-depth tutorials available on video-sharing platforms.  
            <br>
            In order to take advantage of these resources, it is vital to have the ability and willingness to look for them, hence I'd put one's research skills at the very top of necessary skill-set needed to successfully complete digital projects.

        <h2>
            1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT. 
        </h2>
        <p>
            I planned out my website project by creating a kanban board, utilising the Trello service.
            <br> 
            I find making such a board early on in the development process to be immensely helpful when it comes to structuring and carrying out the necessary tasks.
            <br>
            I created a board called 'Website Kanban' – not very inventive, I know, but it serves its purpose well enough. 
            In it, I have several lists such as 'Design', 'To do', 'Done', 'Code Review' and so on.
            <br> 
            All these lists help me define the nature of the tasks I need to carry out and, as I progress in my project, update their status quickly and effectively. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, one on my tasks early on in the project, was to find out how to do a parallax scrolling effect as I wanted to implement it in my website's design. I therefore, added that task to the 'Design' list and went to work. As I researched and implemented the effect into my code, I realised the task was completed and moved it to the 'Done' list. 
            I intend to do the same with every task that needs doing in order to successfully complete the project. 
            <br>
            If you'd like to have a look at my Trello board, simply click <a href="https://trello.com/b/WllobDhk/website-kanban" target="blank"> here. </a> 
            <br>
            <br>
            I found Trello's services to particularly reflect my needs, especially due to it being available as a fully integrated mobile app. I like this feature as often times, an idea will pop in to my head when I'm either out and about or doing something away from my computer and so having access to my board to jot down an idea before I forget it is immensely useful.

        <h2>
            1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Digital projects, just like any other projects, are exposed to a fair amount of risks, which can have a detrimental impact on the success of said project. 
            <br>
            Those risks can sometimes come from unexpected places. If for instance, one uses an online tool, a stable internet connection is a must. Were that internet connection drop, it might make it impossible to not continue working, but also to save the progress already made. 
            <br>
            In order to mitigate such risk, I personally, prefer to save my work  every few minutes, and definitely after a major change. I also like to backup my files, both to a cloud-based server, as well as an external drive, whenever possible). 
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to also consider possible security threats to which a digital project may be exposed. Viruses, malware, ransomware and many, many more, are all possible security risks that need to be mitigated in order to ensure a project's successful delivery. It is important to always ensure your antivirus software, operating system, and any browsers and programs you use up-to-date. I also like to use several tracker blockers with my browsers, such as <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin" target="blank"> uBlock </a> origin or <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook" target="blank"> Facebook container </a>, to ensure greater privacy when browsing the internet.
            <br>
            <br>
            It would also be advisable to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) whenever joining an unsecured network, such as a cafes or train stations when working remotely. A VPN service will divert the user's internet traffic to their own encrypted server, and from there connect to the server of the user's desired website, thus ensuring anonymity and security from attacks made on that unsecured network.
            <br>
            
            I use ProtonVPN as it is a service based is Switzerland which has some of the strongest privacy protection laws in the world. Additionally, they use Perfect Forward Secrecy cyphers which encrypt connection in a way that cannot be captured and decrypted later.
            <br> 
            This is particularly important when handling sensitive data, such as clients' identities or bank details. 
            <br>
            You can find more information about proton VPN by clicking <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="blank"> here </a>.

        <h2>
            1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Having the right equipment can sometimes make or break a project.
            <br> 
            It doesn't necessarily mean that using expensive, top-of-the line hardware will result in a better outcome, however it goes without saying that it would be hardly possible to create a computer program without a computer to work on, or to create a digital painting without the necessary software (such as Photoshop or Gimp). Just like a sculptor needs his chisel, we need the right hardware and software to create our work.
            <br> 
            <br>
            When a project is to create an immersive game with high quality graphics, a good graphics cars is vital to be able to render all those images and models.
            <br>
            When the project is to create a program, it is important to asses which programming language will be most appropriate to work with (e.g. Python) and then to use a code editor such as Microsoft's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="blank">Virtual Studio Code</a> to create that program in. 
            <br>
            Additionally, if the project required the handling of sensitive data, such as personal information, it would be worth considering utilising a private server, even when working from home, not only for efficiency, but predominantly for security purposes.

        <h2>
            1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
        </h2>
        <p>
            A tool I found to be especially helpful when working on projects has been an online kanban board creator Trello. Creating such a board early on in the course of the project, helps to organise workflow and keep on top of relevant tasks. 
            <br>
            This tool is particularly useful when working on a very large project or in a large team as it helps to break down tasks into manageable pieces as well as assign tasks to individual team members.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another online tool I like to use when creating digital projects is the online platform Github. It allows users to store, manage, and publish their code online. For a beginner and professional alike, such a service is indispensable. For me, Github's most attractive feature are its <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories" target="blank" >repositories</a>. They act as a sort of online folder for a project, which can store all of the project's files as well as revision history. 
            <br>
            It is also possible to work and discuss the project from within the repository which is also beneficial for teams. 
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>
            1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are a lot of guidelines and regulations that need to be respected when working with digital content. This is especially true when dealing with personal data.
            <br>
            The EU introduced, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), established established a set of data protection rules and principles which must be adhered to across the European Union.
            <br>
            In the UK, the implementation of GDPR comes under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted" target="blank"> 2018 Data Protection Act</a> and controls how personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection" target="blank"> guidelines</a> with respect to data protection set out by the Data Protection Act include making sure anyone using personal data must make sure the information is:
            
            <ul id="list">
                <li>used fairly, lawfully and transparently</li>
                <li>used for specified, explicit purposes</li>
                
                 <li>used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is necessary</li>
            
                <li>handled in a way that ensures appropriate security</li>
            </ul>

            It is therefore of paramount importance that any personal data used for any given project is handled with appropriate care and security in mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            A great example of why a tight security system is so important when handling sensitive information is the ransomware attack <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/investigation-wannacry-cyber-attack-and-the-nhs/" target="blank">'WannaCry'</a> of May 2017. It is particularly famous for affecting a large network of NHS hospitals and trusts.  
            <br>
            An investigation conducted by the National Audit Office identified that “the attack led to disruption in at least 34% of trusts in England...”
            <br>
            “Thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled and in five areas patients had to travel further to A&E departments.”
            A disruption on this scale, to such a vital service put many people's health and even lives at risk.
            <br> 
            Most importantly, the NHS was warned back in 2014 that changes must be made to boost security, such as moving away from old operating systems (Windows XP). Trusts were issued critical alerts in March and April of 2017 to implement changes in order to prevent cyberattacks, precisely like 'WannaCry', which unfortunately as not happened.
            <br>
            This kind of negligence is precisely what GDPR and Data Protection Act set out to mitigate, at least in the area of secure handling of data.
