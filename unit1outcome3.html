            3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Taking advantage of the latest technologies allowed me to drastically improve my productivity.
            <br> 
            Using services such as Trello to organise my workflow, or using mobile apps such as Forest, had a truly positive impact on my productivity. They helped me to stay focused on the task at hand, and break more difficult issues into manageable pieces.
            <br> 
            I would not have been able to get on with my work without stable internet access as I would not have been able to not only research the relevant topics, but to even learn anything from my teacher.
            <br> 
            The current pandemic, has indeed highlighted just how vital access to technology is in today's society. I would not have been able to access my course without such technology.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Unfortunately, such reliance on technology also makes us somewhat dependent on its functioning. I personally, encountered some problems when downloading Visual Studio Code software, which left me unable to work until I found the solution to the problem and fixed it. 
            <br>
            I also, rather often encounter connection issues when participating in online classes. While it is fantastic that we can still receive education in the given circumstances, it is made a little more difficult when my teacher gets cut off as my internet connection could not keep up.

        <h2>
            3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I found that having the appropriate tools, ones you are familiar with and confident in using is often beneficial to improving efficiency.
            <br> 
            Apart from tools like Trello, I found products aimed at aiding online communication to be indispensable to me when working on  this project.
            <br> 
            Slack and <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="blank">Zoom </a> are the main platforms I used when communicating with my instructor as well as my classmates throughout the course, and which made it possible for me to learn effectively. For this project in particular, Slack made it possible for me to quickly ask my instructor questions when I got stuck and could not find the answer myself.
            <br> 
            Zoom was also extremely useful in those situations, primarily due to its 'screen share' function. This function made it possible to share my screen's output in real time, letting my instructor or any other given call participant see exactly what problem I am having.

        <h2>
            3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.
        </h2>
        <p>
            This project was to be completed individually, which I liked quite a lot.
            <br> 
            I enjoyed the freedom this provided, however I do think I could have benefited from a little team work. Being able to hop on a Zoom call with a couple of colleagues to discuss the best approach  to take to tackle a difficult issue blocking progression would have definitely improved my efficiency when working on this project. 
            <br>
            In the future, I'd certainly try to incorporate more teamwork and collaboration into my projects.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Additionally, this project required some research to be done outside the classroom in order to familiarise oneself with different aspects and capabilities of both HTML and CSS. 
            <br>
            In future projects, I will be able to spend my time more effectively as there will not be as much need for me to lean the basics of HTML or CSS. I will therefore be able to focus on improving my code, integrating more interesting features and improving the overall visitor experience.

        <h2>
            3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Testing a digital project frequently is an absolute must. It allows for quick detection and correction of any mistakes and omissions. It is especially of paramount importance when coding a program, a game, a website etc. 
            <br>
            Testing a program or a game coded in e.g. Python is relatively easy, as it is possible to utilise a built in terminal within the editor to run the code and see whether it functions as intended.
            <br> 
            If there are any issues, it is then quite easy to detect the latest changes made and simply work on fixing them, provided one tests regularly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Testing a website written in HTML is a little different, as this language will not produce an output in the terminal. Instead, any code written needs to be run in a browser. This is where is it possible to see the output created by the code written and detect any issues.
