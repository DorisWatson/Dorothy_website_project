        <h2>
            1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I chose to employ a minimalist theme throughout my website in order to improve clarity and legibility of its content. 
            <br>
            The main area of focus when viewing each page is, at first, the header. The header is comprised of a photograph and two headings, each describing the page on the site the visitor is viewing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The very top of each page features a simple, black navigation bar, allowing the user to navigate the site easily, without distracting from the content of the page. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As the visitor scrolls down, the header and the navigation bar scroll out of view to again, improve legibility of the content below. I employed a parallax scrolling effect on the header as I believe it adds an attractive visual element to the site. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The written content on each page conforms to the same theme throughout the site. The question headings are all a mid-tone shade of grey and are written in a slightly larger font than the paragraphs below them in order to make the questions stand out and provide the reader with a clear distinction between the different sections of the page. 
            <br>
            I chose to use a black background not only for aesthetic purposes, but also to make the site more comfortable to view. A dark background is less strenuous on the viewer's eyes, which is an important aspect to consider when the content of the site is text-heavy.

        <h2>
            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
        </h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copyright-infringement.asp"> Copyright infringement</a> is no laughing matter when  it comes to digital content. It is very easy to simply download someone's work and distribute it as your own, which infringes upon the original creator's intellectual property rights.
            
            <br>
            To mitigate any copyright infringement issues, I made sure to only include stock images on my site. The image I used as my header background can be found <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/beautiful-blooming-pink-flowers-on-branch-4173624/" target="blank">here</a>. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            Many video-sharing websites and social media platforms face a lot of scrutiny over copyright issues. 
            <br>
    
            <a href="https://www.bl.uk/business-and-ip-centre/articles/an-introduction-to-youtube-copyright">YouTube</a> in particular is exposed to a significant amount of copyright problems, with creators both knowingly and unknowingly breaking fair-use rules. 
            Monetising on someone else's intellectual property or including it in own work, from which you are profiting, without the explicit knowledge and approval from the property's owner breaks copyright regulations.
            <br>  
            <br>
            Other constraints which affect digital creators often come from the platforms through which they share their work. 
            <br>
            Platforms such as YouTube or Twitch have a strict policy against showing nudity or animal cruelty, thus any work with such imagery is likely to be pulled from the platform, and the uploader to be reprimanded for their actions.

        <h2>
            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account.
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are plenty of constraints which people with disabilities face online, especially poor sighted and blind individuals using text-to-speech software. Many sites include important information on graphics or videos which cannot be translated into speech.
            <br>
            This makes it impossible for non-sighted individuals to access the site's content and is surely very frustrating and disheartening to discover the site's creator/ designer did not think to make the site accessible to them. 
            <br>
            
            I chose not to employ graphics outside of visual purposes precisely for this reason. I believe information on the internet should be free and accessible to all and will work towards making sure that my projects are as accessible to as wide an audience as possible. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another issue that personally affects me quite often online, is the lack of subtitles on online videos. A lot of the most globally popular content is created in English, with English-speakers in mind. 
            <br>
            However, a significant amount of people do not speak English at all, or speak it as a second language, which makes it difficult for them to enjoy content created in the English language. Subtitles allow non-English speakers and learners to access information outside their native tounge. 
            <br>
            I remember how difficult I found it to watch videos online before I gained fluency in English hence, when I can, I add subtitles or translations to videos posted on video sharing platforms such as YouTube.

        <h2>
            1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Websites are somewhat limited to the kind of files they can hold. Different filetypes also serve different purposes when it comes to website design.
            <br> 
            For instance, image files come in several types, all of which act a little differently from one another and are best suited for different tasks. A JPEG image is great when adding photographs, however it performs rather poorly on images with a lot of text such as annotated diagrams. Here PNG and GIF formats shine.
            <br>

            <br>
            Websites are typically coded in the programming language HTML, often utilising elements such as CSS or JavaScript. 
            <br>
            These types of files are ideal for a website to exist in.
