            Hi there! As you've seen at the top, my name is Dorothy Watson, I'm 26 years old, and I've never learnt how to code!
            <br>
            <br>
            Well, a few weeks ago that would have been true, but now it seems to be a bit of a fib. 
            <br>
            What is definitely true, is that I seem to have only just found my true passion and calling.
            <br>
            <br>
            All my life, I have studied to become an economist and a banker, which I did.
            I got my bachelor's degree in Financial Economics and went off to work in finance, keeping track of my company's finances and investments; making sure we invested in the right thing at the right time.
            <br>
            <br>
            At first, I enjoyed it. I have an avid interest in economics so a career in finance seemed to be a good fit. 
            Unfortunately, I was completely mistaken and my job has, very quickly, left me feeling burnt out. 
            <br>
            I went to work simply because I did not know how to go about changing my career path, thinking I'd have to do something I hate for the rest of my life. 
            <br>
            Luckily, I have been introduced to <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">Codenation</a>, which gave my outlook a complete 180. 
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            Why I've finally decided to take up coding...
        </h2>
        <p>
            I've always gravitated towards programming and tried to learn several programming languages for years unfortunately, to no avail. I enrolled in several online self-study courses in the hopes of finally getting to grips with at least one language, so that I'd be able to explore my interest further.
            <br> 
            However, once again I hit a dead-end, as I found that course to be just as dry and devoid of practical applications as every other I encountered previously. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thankfully, I was introduced to Codenation and finally found the course that truly helped me learn programming and apply my knowledge in a tangible manner. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When it comes to programming, my main area of interest is most definitely game development.
            <br> 
            I have enjoyed playing games since I was rather young, and that interest continued into adulthood.
            <br>
            For many years now I dreamed of developing my own game, however given how completely inexperienced I was I thought that dream would never come into fruition. This has changed now, as even though my journey has merely just begun, I have the basic building bock to now where to start. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            My experience with coding...
        </h2>
        <p>
            Prior to starting this programming course, I had very limited exposure to anything coding-related. 
            As I mentioned, I tried to learn programming languages, however with no success.
            <br>
            This is the first time, I was able to actively learn new material and put my knowledge into action. 
            <br>
            In the short span of the course I managed to not only create this website, but also create two games, coded entirely in python. 
            Given how little experience I have in coding, I must say I'm rather proud of these accomplishments. 
            <br>
            Within the first 2 days of starting the course, I began playing around with the Turtle module in python, with the aim of creating an interactive game with graphical elements. I thought a good place to start would be what some would argue was the very first computer game created â€“ pong. 
            <br>
            To my surprise, I managed to complete the game in two afternoons. I even added some sound clips whenever a player scored a point. 
            I was indeed amazed at how much I was able to do simply because I was shown what even the basics of python are capable of creating. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second game I created, this time as part of the course, was a text-based murder mystery game. 
            Although this game did not have a graphical interface, it still posed quite a challenge. 
            <br>
            I had to make sure that every path a player could take had an appropriate outcome, whether it be the progression of the story, a loop back the the start of the level or even a game over. 
            <br>
            Additionally, since the game was entirely text-based and viewed only within the terminal of the code editor, elements such as pacing, font colour and most importantly, the storyline. 
            <br>
            In the end, I ended up with a short, yet enjoyable little game. At least I hope it's enjoyable. I suppose that's for the player to decide. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, I must say I am beyond delighted at the amount of progress I achieved in just a few weeks, and I cannot wait to see just what else I can learn!
