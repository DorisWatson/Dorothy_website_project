            2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make my website, I had to make use of several different IT tools. 
            <br>
            I started coding my site in HTML programming language and CSS. In order to do that, I used, and continue to use, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor.
            <br> I like to work with it as it is very user-friendly, which was particularly useful for a beginner such as myself. It allows the user to continue working offline, whenever needed, as it is not a cloud-based service. This does unfortunately mean that should the user wish to store their files in a cloud server they will need to do so manually.
            <br> 
            Another tool which I employed was the online kanban board creator, Trello. I also enjoy their services as I like to create such boards for every new project, in order to structure my workflow better and improve my planning. I can do this using Trello quickly, easily, but most importantly remotely. Trello works well on mobile devices, hence I can update my boards with new ideas even when out and about. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With regards to the hardware, I simply utilised my HP Pavilion laptop computer. It isn't a particularly powerful machine, hence were I required to create 3-D graphics or animations to include on my website, I would most likely run into a problem. This project, being simply creating a functioning site, was perfectly within the realm of my laptop's capabilities.
            <br>
            What would have been rather helpful when completing this projecct, is the use of a second screen. Having two screens to work on, would have allowed me much more flexibility in terms of viewing two or even more windows at once. 
            <br>
            This would definitely improve the efficiency of my work. As I progress as a programmer, I will definitely invest in this piece of hardware.

        <h2>
            2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I believe the tools I employed to complete this project were absolutely appropriate.
            <br> 
            Without Visual Studio Code I would not have been able to write any of the necessary code in order to create my website. It would have been rather impossible to write coed without a code editor.
            <br>
            VS Code is supports multiple programming languages, hence it fit my need to write in both HTML and CSS perfectly. 
            Trello also was, to me, greatly useful and needed in this project. It allowed me to structure my work effectively, greatly improving my productivity.
            <br> 
            I believe the hardware employed for this project was also perfectly appropriate. Although, not a particularly powerful machine, the HP Pavilion laptop I worked on suited me just fine for completing this project. Visual Studio Code, being made by Microsoft also works particularly well on Windows operating systems, hence it was a perfect fit.

            2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I'd say I'm quite happy with my website. I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to coding so I did not expect to be able to do quite as much as I did. I am very surprised in a very positive way about just how much I was able to learn and accomplish in a short amount of time.
            <br> 
            I feel my website, albeit simplistic, delivers information I wished to convey in a clear and structured manner. I chose to employ a somewhat minimalist style specifically to improve clarity and legibility. 
            <br>
            If I could change one thing, it would perhaps be a “back to the top” button at the bottom of each page. Most of the pages on my website are very text-heavy and hence somewhat long. Having such a feature would certainly improve the user's experience.

        <h2>
            2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
        </h2>
        <p>
        There are naturally, plenty of ways in which I could improve my website.
        <br> 
		One feature I initially wished to include on my “Home” page, was a video background. I wished to have a short, simple video playing on a loop as the background to add an eye-catching visual element to my site. In the end I decided against it in order to maintain the minimalist theme throughout my site. 
        <br>
        Additionally, I could also add a page purely to showcase my portfolio, which would make it easier for visitors to see my work, as they would not have to look for it on my LinkedIn or Github accounts. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I strongly believe the final product matches the requirements set out by the assessment.
            <br> 
            Every page of my site is functioning well, with the same clear, minimalist theme appearing throughout.
            <br> 
            Information is conveyed in an easy to read and structured manner, with a separate heading for each question.
            <br> 
            Additionally, the site features a functioning navbar, which takes the visitor to the appropriate page on the site upon clicking. 
            My site also features a photo background as part of its theme which was added in CSS. The background also functions well throughout the various pages of the site. 
            <br>
            My contact information page contains working, clickable links; one opening the visitor's email program with my email address pre-filled (mail to: feature), the other sending them to my LinkedIn profile.   
            <br>
            My site also features several links to references I used when answering the assessment brief, throughout. The links are clickable and take the reader straight to the source I used, opening a new tab so as to make it easier to go back to my site's content after reviewing the source.
